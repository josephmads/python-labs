# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
float(2) 
# 2) Convert a float to an int
int(2.1)
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
3.2 / 2
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
num1 = 2
num2 = 4.2
print(num1 * num2)
#
# What information is lost during which conversions?

# When converting a float to an integer, any fractional 
# value of the number is lost.
